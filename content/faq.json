          "id": "what-is-health-sharing",
          "question": "What is medical cost sharing?",
          "answer": "Medical cost sharing is a healthcare model where members contribute monthly amounts that are used to pay for each other's eligible medical expenses. It's based on the principle of mutual aid, where a community comes together to share healthcare costs. This is not traditional health insurance, but rather a voluntary arrangement between members.",

        {
          "id": "vs-insurance",
          "question": "How is health sharing different from traditional insurance?",
          "answer": "Health sharing is not insurance and is not regulated by state insurance departments. There are no guarantees that medical expenses will be shared, though our community has a strong track record. Unlike insurance, there are typically no provider networks, and you can see any licensed healthcare provider. Health sharing also often costs significantly less than traditional insurance.",

          "id": "what-is-iua",
          "question": "What is an Initial Unsharable Amount (IUA)?",
          "answer": "The IUA is similar to a deductible in traditional insurance. It's the amount you pay out-of-pocket before the community begins sharing your medical expenses. Different plans have different IUA amounts, ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 annually depending on the plan you choose.",

        {
          "id": "how-sharing-works",
          "question": "How does the sharing process work?",
          "answer": "When you have eligible medical expenses, you submit them through our online portal or mobile app. The expenses are reviewed according to the sharing guidelines, and if eligible, they are shared by the community. Payments are typically sent directly to healthcare providers, and you receive updates throughout the process.",
